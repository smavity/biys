# BIYS-Build It Yourself Sanitizer
BIYS is an open-source easy to build sanitizer units to help prevent local transmission of disease.
The objective of the project is to create an open-source touchless automatic sanitizer unit that allows us to stay safe in the event of a disease outbreak like the COVID-19.
BIYS can be easily assembled and built by enthusiasts and non-technical individuals because we employ components already used by the DIY community while designing the unit.
